# BuyCoins-Github_Challenge

A Single page web page built with vanilla javascript , html and css.
Due to Other engagements i couldnt spend enough time on this work. Feel free to report any issue encountered while using the web app for immediate fix thanks.

Live Demo : https://github-repo-whyte.netlify.app/

## Code Pattern

I prefer writing seperate codes for my Mobile and web versions as i believe this helps in fixing issues.

Thinking about code reusability : for me i work with the approach of making the code function first before refactoring.
